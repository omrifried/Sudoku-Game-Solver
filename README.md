# Project: Sudoku Solver

##### Current Edition: V1
##### Project Description: 
The Java based applet can be used to play the game of Sudoku. The program
allows a user to either enter an existing game board or create a random
board automatically. If an automatic board is chosen, the user will have
the ability to select the game difficulty from easy, medium, or hard.

Once the board is created, the user can solve the puzzle directly in the
applet. The user can then check their solution to determine if they solved
the game board correctly. Additionally, the user can solve the board by 
pressing the solve button which will automatically solve the game board.

The program uses the backtracking algorithm to create and solve the game 
board. 

##### Bugs:
V1 - Insufficient filters on manual board creation: the program currently 
does not check to see whether the entered board only has one possible solution.
